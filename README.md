A comprehensive guide and reference implementation for building, deploying, and managing LLM-powered agents within Databricks environments.

## Overview

This repository provides a complete blueprint for creating effective AI agents on Databricks. It covers the entire agent lifecycle from planning and development to deployment and monitoring, with a focus on practical implementation patterns for enterprise use cases.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Playbook**: Step-by-step guide for agent creation and deployment
- **Reference Implementations**: Working examples of agents, functions, and toolkits
- **Customizable Templates**: Start with templates to accelerate your agent development
- **Testing Framework**: Structured approach to agent testing and evaluation
- **Monitoring Solutions**: Tools for tracking performance, usage, and quality
- **Deployment Pipeline**: CI/CD workflows for reliable agent deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace (E2 or higher tier recommended)
- Databricks Runtime 14.0+ with ML libraries
- Unity Catalog enabled workspace
- SQL warehouse (for SQL Toolkit functionality)
- Git integration configured in your workspace

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository to your Databricks workspace:

```
%pip install -U databricks-cli
dbutils.fs.mkdirs("/Repos/databricks-agent-playbook")
%sh git clone https://github.com/yourusername/databricks-agent-playbook.git /Repos/databricks-agent-playbook
```

2. Run the setup notebook to prepare your environment:

```
dbutils.notebook.run("/Repos/databricks-agent-playbook/notebooks/setup/setup_environment.py", 600)
```

3. Explore the example agents:

- NBA Analysis Agent: `/Repos/databricks-agent-playbook/notebooks/agents/nba_analysis_agent.py`
- Draft Scout Agent: `/Repos/databricks-agent-playbook/notebooks/agents/draft_scout_agent.py`

4. Adapt the templates to your use case:

- Agent Template: `/Repos/databricks-agent-playbook/resources/templates/agent_template.py`
- Function Template: `/Repos/databricks-agent-playbook/resources/templates/function_template.py`
